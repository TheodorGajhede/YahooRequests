## Usage
Here's how you can use Yahoo Requests to retrieve company data in Python:
```python
from YahooRequests import YahooRequests as yr

# Get the live price of Google in USD
price = yr.price("googl")

# Get the full company name of Google
name = yr.name("googl")

# Get the converted price of Google (supports currency codes)
converted_price = yr.price("googl", "eur")

# Full company name of Google with no suffix (like inc or corp)
# If no argument is given, this will be included
no_suffix_name = yr.name("googl", suffix=False)

# Return a simple table with different information about the company
table_company = yr.basic_info("googl")

# Return the most popular news article about a company (Early access feature)
news = yr.news("googl", timespan=5, warning=True)

# Return the average price of a stock in a time period
average_price = yr.average_price("aapl", "2021-1-1", "2022-1-1")
```

## Footnotes
Currency codes can be found [Here](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes).

Average analyst rating explanation:

- *If the average rating is close to 5, that means most analysts rate the stock as a sell.
 Conversely, if the average rating is close to 1, most analysts have a "buy" or "strong buy" rating.
In summary, analyst ratings are often aggregated into a single score on a scale of 1â€“5.*
